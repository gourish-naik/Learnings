## JavaScript & React Machine Coding Questions

### 1. To-Do List (Redux Version)

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";

const ADD_TASK = "ADD_TASK";
const TOGGLE_TASK = "TOGGLE_TASK";

const addTask = (text) => ({ type: ADD_TASK, payload: text });
const toggleTask = (index) => ({ type: TOGGLE_TASK, payload: index });

const todoReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_TASK:
      return [...state, { text: action.payload, completed: false }];
    case TOGGLE_TASK:
      return state.map((task, i) => i === action.payload ? { ...task, completed: !task.completed } : task);
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

function TodoApp() {
  const [task, setTask] = useState("");
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const tasks = useSelector(state => state);

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={task} onChange={(e) => setTask(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={() => { dispatch(addTask(task)); setTask(""); }}>Add Task</button>
      <ul>
        {tasks.map((t, index) => (
          <li key={index} style={{ textDecoration: t.completed ? "line-through" : "none" }}>
            {t.text} <button onClick={() => dispatch(toggleTask(index))}>Toggle</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
export default TodoApp;
```

### 2. Star Rating Component

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function StarRating({ totalStars = 5 }) {
  const [rating, setRating] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      {[...Array(totalStars)].map((_, i) => (
        <span key={i} onClick={() => setRating(i + 1)} style={{ cursor: "pointer", color: i < rating ? "gold" : "gray" }}>
          â˜…
        </span>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
export default StarRating;
```

### 3. Render Object Data in Table

```jsx
function DataTable({ data }) {
  return (
    <table border="1">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          {Object.keys(data[0]).map((key) => (
            <th key={key}>{key}</th>
          ))}
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {data.map((row, i) => (
          <tr key={i}>
            {Object.values(row).map((val, j) => (
              <td key={j}>{val}</td>
            ))}
          </tr>
        ))}
      </tbody>
    </table>
